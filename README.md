This single-file app is a serverless AI platform with a 2007 Web 2.0 aesthetic. It uses Puter.js for real-time chat and localStorage to save characters, personas, and history. Features include a creation studio, session-based login, and ownership logic. Built with vanilla JS and CSS, it mimics classic web styles while running entirely in-browser.
